# MVC Example

## Summary

An example on how to use the MVC pattern to share code between Unity and
console C# implementations of the same program/game. Common code between
implementations (e.g., the Model in MVC) lives in a separate orphan branch and
exists as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
inside each implementation's folder.
